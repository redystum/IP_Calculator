# Ip_Calculator

<img src="./gif/calc.gif"/>

The objective of this project is to create an ip calculator with a simple code so that I and all the programmers can understand... It's the first time I use python, if there are easier ways to do what I did... it's normal


PS: I tried to use a minimum of libraries to be able to explore the language better...
